# Red Team vs Blue Team Cyber Warfare Simulation

This project is a web-based simulation platform designed to educate users about cybersecurity concepts through a Red Team vs Blue Team scenario.

## Features

1. **Interactive Simulation**: Users can choose to be a Red Team attacker or a Blue Team defender.
2. **Real-World Attacks**: Simulates various cyberattacks, including:
    - Brute Force
    - Phishing
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - SQL Injection
3. **Defensive Strategies**: Learn about and implement mitigation techniques for each attack.
4. **Educational Resources**: Provides information about attack methods and corresponding defenses.

## Technologies

1. **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. **(Optional) Backend**: Python (for more complex simulations or user data storage)

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a web browser and a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/red-team-blue-team-sim.git
    cd red-team-blue-team-sim
    ```
3. **Open `index.html`**: Open `index.html` in your web browser to launch the simulation.

## How to Use

1. **Select your team**: Choose Red or Blue using the radio buttons.
2. **Choose your attack/defense combination**.
3. **View Results**: A specific results page will open, demonstrating the chosen attack and its mitigation (if applicable).
4. **Start Simulation**: The "Start Simulation" button opens a general animation about the attack-defense scenario.
5. **Real-Time Simulation**: The "Real Time Simulation" button opens a results page specific to your attack/defense selection.

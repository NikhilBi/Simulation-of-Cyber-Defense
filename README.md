Red Team vs Blue Team Cyber Warfare Simulation
This project is a web-based simulation platform designed to educate users about cybersecurity concepts through a Red Team vs Blue Team scenario.

Features:
•	Interactive Simulation: Users can choose to be a Red Team attacker or a Blue Team defender.
•	Real-World Attacks: Simulates various cyberattacks, including: 
    o	Brute Force
    o	Phishing
    o	Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    o	SQL Injection
•	Defensive Strategies: Learn about and implement mitigation techniques for each attack.
•	Educational Resources: Provides information about attack methods and corresponding defenses.

Technologies:
•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
•	(Optional) Backend: Python (for more complex simulations or user data storage)

Getting Started:
1.	Prerequisites: Ensure you have a web browser and basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2.	Clone the Repository: Use git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/red-team-blue-team-sim.git to clone this repository.
3.	Open index.html: Open index.html in your web browser to launch the simulation.

How to Use:
•	Select your team (Red or Blue) using the radio buttons.
•	Choose your attack/defense combination.
•	Based on your selections, a specific results page will open, demonstrating the chosen attack and its mitigation (if applicable).
•	The "Start Simulation" button opens a general animation about the attack-defense scenario.
•	The "Real Time Simulation" button opens a results page specific to your attack/defense selection.
